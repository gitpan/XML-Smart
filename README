XML::Smart - A Smart, easy and powerful way to access/create XML files/data.

###############
# DESCRIPTION #
###############

This module has an easy way to access/create XML data. It's based on the HASH
tree that is made of the XML data, and enable a dynamic access to it with the
Perl syntax for Hashe and Array, without needing to care if you have a Hashe or an
Array in the tree. In other words, each point in the tree work as a Hash and
Array at the same time!

** See POD for documentation and examples!
